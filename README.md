# MisterManager

**MisterManager** is an open-source inventory management system for tracking items across storage locations. It provides a clear overview of your articles, their locations, and expiration dates, along with helpful statistics like items added and consumed over time. All data is stored locally on your device, with manual export/import options.

As an [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project released under the **MIT License**, you can explore the source code, build it yourself, and contribute. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

MisterManager is based on our earlier app [OpenYarnStash](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/OpenYarnStash), which was designed for yarn and knitting/crochet projects.

Built with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)#Multiplatform) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/), OpenFridge targets Android, iOS, Web, and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) from a single codebase.

This project was developed as an experiment in AI-assisted coding ("vibe coding"), comparing different AI models. Parts of the code were generated with **Claude Code** (Anthropic) and **Gemini** (Google). UI icons were created using **ChatGPT** prompts.
